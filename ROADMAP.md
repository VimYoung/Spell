# Roadmap for upcoming releases

This is a dump file where every feature is dumped which pops in my mind and I
find interesting enough to implement in the crate in the future. Following is the
list in no particular order.

1. Repeated key implemented for backspace for `SpellWin` and `SpellLock`.
2. Keyboard enter issue fixed for all layers in multi-window setup.
3. NetworkManger added.
4. Notification Manager.
5. Bluetooth manager added.
6. Process interupt command in Logs.
7. Add some Popup implementation for xdg.
8. Implement multi window adapter in multiple threads for better performance in Niri.
